# Merge Sort

Merge sort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm based on the idea of breaking down a list into
several sub-lists until each sublist consists of a single element and merging those sublists in a manner that results into a sorted list.

## Algorithm
```
Step 1: Divide array into two halves.
Step 2: Repeat step 1 unless you get minimum 2 elements.
Step 3: Merge Sub-elements in order.
Step 4: Repeat step 3 unless you get sorted array.
```
